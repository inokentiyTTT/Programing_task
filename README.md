Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA):
It explicitly creates a suite of standard structure in time series data and it provides a simple and powerful method for forecasting.
It combines both autoregressive and moving average models as well as a differencing pre-processing step of the sequence to make the sequence stationary. 

This method supports univariate time series with trend and without seasonal component. 

The statsmodel library provides the capability to fit ARIMA models.
